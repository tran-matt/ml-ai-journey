# Week 02 – Intro to Machine Learning + Titanic Project

## Dates: June 17 – June 23, 2025  
## Phase: Month 1 – Python & Math for ML  
**Platform:** [Kaggle Learn: Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)

---

## Weekly Goals
- Understand the ML workflow: train/test split, model fitting, evaluation
- Build your first predictive model using `scikit-learn`
- Apply concepts in a Titanic survival prediction notebook
- Push your first ML project to GitHub

## 💡 Key Learnings

- How to split data with `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection`
- Basic syntax for `.fit()`, `.predict()`, and `.score()`
- Why validation sets matter for model reliability
- Differences between simple and ensemble methods (e.g., Decision Tree vs Random Forest)

---

## 🛠️ Project Tracker: Titanic Model

- [ ] Create a new notebook in `projects/titanic_model/`
- [ ] Import and explore the Titanic dataset
- [ ] Train multiple models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- [ ] Evaluate performance with accuracy or cross-validation
- [ ] Write a clean `README.md` for the project
- [ ] Push to GitHub
