# ⚙Week 04 – ML Engineering Tools & Deployment

## Dates: July 1 – July 7, 2025  
## Phase: Month 3 → Month 4 Transition  
**Focus:** Git, virtual environments, model packaging, and simple app deployment

---

## Weekly Goals
- Learn how to track, version, and share ML projects
- Use Git and GitHub for collaboration and version control
- Package and deploy a simple ML model using Flask/FastAPI
- Host the deployed app on Render, Hugging Face Spaces, or Replit

## Tooling & Concepts

- `git init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`
- Setting up `venv`, `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- Writing your first API route in Flask or FastAPI
- Model serialization: `joblib`, `pickle`, or `.pt`
- Free deployment options: Render.com, Hugging Face Spaces, or Replit

---

## Project: Deployed Titanic or MNIST Model

- [ ] Choose which model to deploy (Titanic or MNIST)
- [ ] Save model to file using `joblib` or `torch.save()`
- [ ] Create basic Flask or FastAPI app
- [ ] Test locally with `curl` or Postman
- [ ] Deploy publicly and add URL to your repo
- [ ] Write a README with install/run/deploy instructions

## Reflection Prompts
- What did you learn about deployment that surprised you?
- What tools or platforms felt most intuitive?
- Would you do anything differently next time?
